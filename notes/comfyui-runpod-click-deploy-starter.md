# ComfyUI RunPod Click-Deploy Starter

Spin up ComfyUI on RunPod in minutes—no local installs, drivers, or CUDA headaches. This guide uses the official ComfyUI template on RunPod and an optional one-liner to fetch models and custom nodes, so you can focus on creating images and videos instead of wrestling with setup. Pay only for GPU time while your pod is running.

## Quick Start

This flow gets you from zero to a working ComfyUI instance quickly.

1) Create a RunPod account and add a few dollars of credit.  
2) Deploy a new Pod:
- In RunPod, go to Pods → Deploy.
- Pick a GPU. A good starting point: RTX 3090 for cost-effective learning. Need more speed? Try RTX 5090.
- In Template → Change Template, select the official “ComfyUI” template (runpod/comfyui:latest).
- Click Deploy On-Demand.

3) Wait for the ComfyUI service to reach Ready on port 8188.  
4) Click the ComfyUI service to open the UI in your browser.

Optional: Preload models and custom nodes with a single command generated by deploy.promptingpixels.com.

```bash
# In the RunPod Pod view: Connect → Enable Web Terminal → Open Web Terminal
# Then paste the installer command you copied from https://deploy.promptingpixels.com
# Example shape (do not copy directly):
# bash <(wget -qO- <generated-url>) \
#   --provider runpod \
#   --hf-token hf_xxx... \
#   --civitai-token civitai_xxx... \
#   --models "RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9" \
#   --custom-nodes "ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale"

# When the script completes, return to the ComfyUI tab, open Manager, and click Restart to load new content.
```

## Usage

Here’s a practical walkthrough that mirrors a typical first session: pick a base model, generate images, upscale them, and download the results.

- Open the ComfyUI page from your Pod’s Connect panel (port 8188).
- From the workflow/template browser, load a basic text-to-image template.
- Choose a base model (for example, JuggernautXL or RealVisXL if you installed one).
- Enter your prompt and negative prompt, set resolution (e.g., 1024x1024), and pick the number of images.
- If you installed an upscaler node (like UltimateSDUpscale), add it to the workflow to enhance the output.
- Click Queue/Generate to run the graph.
- To fetch outputs, open the File Browser service (port 8080). Sign in with Username: admin and Password: adminadmin12. Browse to ComfyUI/output and download files.

```bash
# Verify the ComfyUI service is up (optional health check)
curl -I http://<your-pod-endpoint>:8188 | head -n 1
# Expect an HTTP/1.1 200 OK or similar

# After generating images in the UI:
# Download your images through the File Browser (port 8080) using the web UI.
# Path: runpod-slim/ComfyUI/output

# Cost control:
# When you’re done, stop the Pod from the Pods dashboard to pause billing.
# If you no longer need the environment, stop it first, then terminate to remove all resources.
```

## Configuration

If you use the installer generator (deploy.promptingpixels.com), you’ll get a one-liner with flags like the ones below. These options control how models and nodes are pulled into your ComfyUI pod.

| Key | Required | Description | Example |
|-----|----------|-------------|---------|
| provider | Yes | Cloud provider to target | runpod |
| template | No | Pod template image tag | runpod/comfyui:latest |
| gpu | No | GPU tier guidance for deployment | 3090, 5090 |
| disk_gb | No | Persistent disk size for models | 200 |
| hf_token | No | Auth token for gated Hugging Face models | hf_abc123... |
| civitai_token | No | Auth token for Civitai downloads | civitai_abc123... |
| models | No | One or more base/checkpoint models to install | RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9 |
| custom_nodes | No | ComfyUI custom nodes to add | ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale |
| output_dir | No | Folder where images are saved | ComfyUI/output |
| comfyui_port | No | HTTP port for ComfyUI | 8188 |
| filebrowser_port | No | HTTP port for File Browser | 8080 |

Notes:
- Tokens are only needed if you plan to fetch gated models or rate-limited assets.
- You can add LoRAs, VAE files, ControlNet weights, and other assets using the same generator—just check the items you want and re-run the command in the Web Terminal.

## How It Works

- RunPod hosts a GPU-backed container based on the official ComfyUI template, exposing the ComfyUI server on port 8188 and a File Browser on port 8080. The template includes the runtime and core dependencies so you don’t install anything locally.
- The installer one-liner from deploy.promptingpixels.com assembles a script tailored to your selections. It downloads models from Hugging Face and Civitai and places them into the correct ComfyUI directories, then installs any requested custom nodes under ComfyUI/custom_nodes.
- Outputs from your workflows go to ComfyUI/output, which you can browse and download with the File Browser. Stop the pod when idle to pause costs; restart later and your models persist on the attached disk.
